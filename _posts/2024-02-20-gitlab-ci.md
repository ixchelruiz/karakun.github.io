Not so rarely, different components in a project rely to each other in a way that requires your pipeline to interact with other components pipelines. Not only large software development projects might be customers to such usecases, also ustilizing GitLab CI runners to execute infrastructure automation tasks is a great use case. Or the combination of these as I was confronted with - only if a release of the project would be successfully build, we wanted to run a pipeline in a different gitlab repository which contains the infrastructure automation to deploy that release to the target environments.

Using GitLab CI, I recently found out, is a great advantage in such situation as it provides great felxibility to setup such szenario.

Here are the required steps:

```
trigger-deployment:
  stage: build
  only:
    refs:
      - tags
    variables:
      - $CI_COMMIT_TAG =~ /^[Rr]elease-.*/
  trigger:
    project: infra-grp/deplyoment-scripts
    branch: release-to-integration
    strategy: depend
```

In Project A the pipeline file, e.g. `.gitlab-ci.yml` , is extended with a job that reacts on a given pattern of tag names - in our case anything that start with "release-" or "Release-" as defined by the RegExp `/^[Rr]elease-.*/` . (Yes, learing RegExp is still a useful thing, I can only recommend to dig into it - has has been proven useful to me in many projects now and is definetly well invested time for every Software Engineer, Developer, DevOps Engineer or what ever title the industry comes up with ;-) ).

The `trigger:` block then references the project and the branch we want to be run.

Some special attention should be paid to `trigger:strategy` as this can force the job to wait for the downstream pipeline to complete before it is marked as success which is opposed to the default that acts more like an "~~fire~~ trigger and forget". But keep in mind that is also turns the pipeline into being more sequential than parallel and thus take more time to complete.

All the details can be found in the [GitLab documentation for triggers](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/triggers/).
