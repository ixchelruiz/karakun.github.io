title: Why Software Testing Is a Waste of Time
speakers: francois
excerpt: >
  Testing software takes up a lot of time in the software development process, often the same amount of time if not more than the time required for the development itself.
  Just like development, testing also requires continued maintenance efforts.
  This (rightfully so) makes a lot of people in different roles, be it managers, developers or even testers question whether or not that time effort is really justified.
  With more and more companies deploying every 10 minutes or even less start to wonder: why invest time in testing when you can simply rollback issues in a matter of seconds, in some cases even automatically?

Testing software takes up a lot of time in the software development process, often the same amount of time if not more than the time required for the development itself.
Just like development, testing also requires continued maintenance efforts.

Fran√ßois will show you how to avoid common pitfalls and time wasters, and what you can do to make your testing strategy more efficient in this talk!
